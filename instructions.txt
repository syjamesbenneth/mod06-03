while (condition/s) {
	do as long as condition/s is/are true.
	increment/decrement of condition
}
}
xxx

*use a span and a while loop to print your name 10 times

xxx

*use another span and a while loop to display 1 to 15;

do-while loop.
syntax:
initialization
do {
	do while conditions are true
	increment/decrement
} while (condition/s)

xxx

*use another span ad a do while loop display one of your rowmate's name 8 times.


xxx
while loop and do while loop difference
*while loop checks conditions first before doing the loop body, do-while loop checks condition AFTER doing the loop body.

xxx
for loop.
syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	do something here.
}

Using continue in loops
for numbers where i 0 to 9
if i is even skip to the next i
then add i to the current total

var value = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	if (i % 2 == 0) {
	continue
	}
	value = value + i;
}
alert (value);
